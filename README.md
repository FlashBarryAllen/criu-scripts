Some stupid scripts to analyze criu

* sat.py -- strace analyzer tool. Can show timing statistics from strace logs. See script's header comment for usage examples.
* wwt.sh -- Who-Wrote-This script. Shows git based statistics about commits and lines of code for people or companies.
* stopexec -- tool to stop a process before calling execve() thus making a process easily dumpable.
* ptrace-wait -- tool to wait for any task to exit regardless of parent-child relations.
